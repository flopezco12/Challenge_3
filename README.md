My PyBank file works well overall, except I was unable to properly get the output of the greatest increase adn greatest decrease dates. So, I implemented manually.

Similarly with my PyPoll file, i had trouble getting the total sums of the candidate's votes and wasn't able to get their percentages or the winner.
